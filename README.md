# Odin Recipes

This project's objective is to create a basic recipes website to put into practice the knowledge acquired up to this moment:

- Manage files through the command line
- Create an HTML boilerplate
- Create Lists
- Embed images
- Create links
- Use Git basic commands
- Commit messages

This will be an evolving project: new features will be added as I progress through the curriculum.

This is the beginning.
